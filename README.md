# Multi-Agent Fuzzy Neural Network for Stock Prediction

This project explores a novel and interpretable approach for **stock price prediction** using a combination of:
- **Fuzzy Logic**,  
- **Transformer-based Deep Neural Networks**, and  
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning** strategies.

It targets long-term profitability through dynamic portfolio optimization on **SGX-listed stocks**, leveraging clustering, Monte Carlo-based feature selection, and interpretable decision-making.
